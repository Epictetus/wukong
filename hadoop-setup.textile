h3. Miscellaneous Hadoop Tips

* The Cloudera AMIs and distribution include BZip2 support.  This means that if you have input files with a .bz2 extension, they will be naturally un-bzipped and streamed. (Note that there is a non-trivial penalty for doing so: each bzip'ed file must go, in whole, to a single mapper; and the CPU load for un-bzipping is sizeable.)

* To _produce_ bzip2 files, specify the new @--compress_output=@ flag.  If you have the BZip2 patches installed, you can give @--compress_output=bz2@; everyone should be able to use @--compress_output=gz@.

* For excellent performance you can patch your install for "Parallel LZO Splitting":http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/06/24/parallel-lzo-splittable-compression-for-hadoop/
