== Conclusion ==

On the papers looked at most of them are focused on IT-related areas, there is lots of unwritten in academia about mapreduce and hadoop applied for algorithms in other business and technology areas. </p>

Opportunity for following up this posting can be to: 1)&nbsp;in more detail describe the algorithms (e.g. input/output formats), 2) try to classify them by patterns (e.g. with similar code structure), 3) offer the opportunity to simulate them in the browser (on toy-sized data sets) and 4) provide links to Hadoop implementations of them.
