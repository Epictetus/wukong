Wukong::AndPig is a small library to more easily generate code for the
"Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig data analysis language.  

Wukong::AndPig lets you use the structs from your Wukong scripts to
generate Pig instructions that know their types and structure -- even through
multiple pig commands. For example, if you use +FOREACH ... GENERATE+ to select
only a few of those fields, Wukong::AndPig will know that the result has only
those fields.

We're still trying to figure out if this is a stupid and crazy idea, or just a
crazy idea: Yeah, we're using a functional/OO scripting language to generate code for an
imperative query language that generates Java code for ad-hoc map-reduce operations.
