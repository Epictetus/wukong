  Treat your dataset like a:

      * stream of lines when it’s efficient to process by lines
      * stream of field arrays when it’s efficient to deal directly with fields
      * stream of lightweight objects when it’s efficient to deal with objects

  Wukong is friends with Hadoop the elephant, Pig the query language, and the cat on your command line.
