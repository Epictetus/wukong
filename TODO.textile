Utility

* columnizing / reconstituting

* Set up with JRuby
* Allow for direct HDFS operations
* Make the dfs commands slightly less stupid
* add more standard options
* Allow for combiners
* JobStarter / JobSteps

BUGS:

* Can't do multiple input files in local mode

Patterns to implement:

* Stats reducer (takes sum, avg, max, min, std.dev of a numeric field)
* Make StructRecordizer work generically with other reducers (spec. AccumulatingReducer)

Example graph scripts:

* Multigraph
* Pagerank 		(done)
* Breadth-first search  
* Triangle enumeration  
* Clustering

Example example scripts (from http://www.cloudera.com/resources/learning-mapreduce): 

1. Find the [number of] hits by 5 minute timeslot for a website given its access logs.

2. Find the pages with over 1 million hits in day for a website given its access logs.

3. Find the pages that link to each page in a collection of webpages.

4. Calculate the proportion of lines that match a given regular expression for a collection of documents.

5. Sort tabular data by a primary and secondary column.

6. Find the most popular pages for a website given its access logs.
