h2. Wukong + Hadoop can help


h2. Map|Reduce

h3. cat input.tsv | mapper.sh | sort | reducer.sh > output.tsv

* Bobo histogram:

  cat twitter_users.tsv | cuttab 3 | cutc 1-6 | sort | uniq -c > histogram.tsv

  cat twitter_users.tsv | \
    cuttab 3 |                  # extract the date column               \
    cutc 1-6 |                  # chop off all but the yearmonth        \
    sort     |                  # sort, to ensure locality              \
    uniq -c  >                  # roll up lines, along with their count \
    histogram.tsv               # save into output file
  
  
h3. Word Count


h3. Word Count by Person

* Partition Keys vs. Reduce Keys

- reduce by [word, <total>, count] and [word, user_id, count]
