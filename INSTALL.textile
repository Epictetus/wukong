h2. Get the code

Wukong is still under active development.  The newest version is available via "Git":http://git-scm.com on "github:":http://github.com/mrflip/{{ site.gemname }}

pre. $ git clone git://github.com/mrflip/{{ site.gemname }}

A gem is available from "github:":http://gems.github.com

pre. $ sudo gem install mrflip-{{ site.gemname }} --source=http://gems.github.com

or from "gemcutter":http://gemcutter.org

pre. $ sudo gem install {{ site.gemname }} --source=http://gemcutter.org

You can instead download this project in either "zip":http://github.com/mrflip/{{ site.gemname }}/zipball/master or "tar":http://github.com/mrflip/{{ site.gemname }}/tarball/master formats.

h2. Setup

1. Allow Wukong to discover where his elephant friend lives: either
** set a $HADOOP_HOME environment variable,
** or create a file 'config/wukong-site.yaml' with a line that points to the top-level directory of your hadoop install: @:hadoop_home: /usr/local/share/hadoop@
2. Add wukong's @bin/@ directory to your $PATH, so that you may use its filesystem shortcuts.

h2. Installing and Running Wukong under Hadoop

Wukong is used by many in an non-Hadoop environment -- anywhere you can stream data records you can unleash its monkey power.  It was developed for Hadoop, though, and we think it's actually the best (and certainly the most fun) way to use Hadoop.

h3. Set up a Hadoop cluster

To set up hadoop, your best bet are the Cloudera AMIs on Amazon's EC2 compute cloud:

* http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2
* http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-ec2-ebs-beta

EC2 means anyone with a $10 bill can rent a 10-machine cluster with 1TB of distributed storage for 8 hours.

If you have a local cluster, or just want to experiment with a single-machine install, check out the Cloudera packages for both Debian/Ubuntu-based and Redhat/RPM-based Linux systems.

h3. Run Wukong on the Amazon AWS EC2 Cloud

Phil Ripperger has prepared "instructions on getting wukong to work on the Amazon AWS cloud":http://blog.pdatasolutions.com/post/191978092/ruby-on-hadoop-quickstart that are better than anything we could put here. Thanks Phil!
